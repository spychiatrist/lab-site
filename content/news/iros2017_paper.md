The paper "Socially Competent Navigation Planning by Deep Learning of
Multi-Agent Path Topologies", by [Christoforos Mavrogiannis]({{< ref "people/chris.md" >}}), [Valts 
Blukis]({{< ref "people/valts.md" >}}), and [Ross Knepper]({{< ref "people/ross.md" >}}) has been 
accepted to **[IROS 2017](http://iros2017.org)**.

From the paper:

  > We present a novel, data-driven framework for planning socially competent robot behaviors in 
  > crowded environments. The core of our approach is a topological model of collective navigation 
  > behaviors, based on braid groups. This model constitutes the basis for the design of a 
  > human-inspired probabilistic inference mechanism that predicts the topology of multiple agents’ 
  > future trajectories, given observations of the context. We derive an approximation of this 
  > mechanism by employing a neural network learning architecture on synthetic data of collective 
  > navigation behaviors. Our planner makes use of this mechanism as a tool for interpreting the 
  > context and understanding what future behaviors are in compliance with it. The planning agent 
  > makes use of this understanding to determine a personal action that contributes to the context 
  > in the most clear way possible, while ensuring progress to its destination. Our simulations 
  > provide evidence that our planning framework results in socially competent navigation behaviors 
  > not only for the planning agent, but also for interacting naive agents. Performance benefits 
  > include (1) early conflict resolutions and (2) faster uncertainty decrease for the other agents 
  > in the scene.
