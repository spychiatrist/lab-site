Nathan received his B.S.E. in Computer Science from Cornell Engineering in 2016.  
He is now a final-year M.S. student in an experimental program in Virtual Reality Technology who is working on a minor degree project with RPAL: Particle Filter Visualization for Latency Compensation in VR Robotic Teleoperation.
He has too many interests, and the greatest of them lie in real-time online rendering, virtual reality game/experience design, robotic teleoperation, rapid tooling, 3D user interfaces, computer architecture, and woodworking.
