      <description>The paper &amp;ldquo;Socially Competent Navigation Planning by Deep Learning of Multi-Agent Path Topologies&amp;rdquo;, by Christoforos Mavrogiannis, Valts Blukis, and Ross Knepper has been accepted to IROS 2017.
From the paper:
 We present a novel, data-driven framework for planning socially competent robot behaviors in crowded environments. The core of our approach is a topological model of collective navigation behaviors, based on braid groups. This model constitutes the basis for the design of a human-inspired probabilistic inference mechanism that predicts the topology of multiple agents’ future trajectories, given observations of the context.</description>

      <description>The paper &amp;ldquo;Implicit Communication in a Joint Action&amp;rdquo;, by Ross Knepper, Christoforos Mavrogiannis, Julia Proft, and Claire Liang, has been accepted to HRI 2017.
From the paper:
 Actions performed in the context of a joint activity comprise two aspects: functional and communicative. The functional component achieves the goal of the action, whereas its communicative component, when present, expresses some information to the actor’s partners in the joint activity. The interpretation of such communication requires leveraging information that is public to all participants, known as common ground.</description>

      <description>The paper &amp;ldquo;Decentralized Multi-Agent Navigation Planning with Braids&amp;rdquo;, by Christoforos Mavrogiannis and Ross Knepper, was presented at WAFR 2016.
From the paper:
 We present a novel planning framework for navigation in dynamic, multi-agent environments with no explicit communication among agents, such as pedestrian scenes. Inspired by the collaborative nature of human navigation, our approach treats the problem as a coordination game, in which players coordinate to avoid each other as they move towards their destinations.</description>
